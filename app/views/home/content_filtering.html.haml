        Kudoso is passionate about protecting your kids.  So we didn't go the "easy route" and buy some old, outdated list of websites
        and try to use that as filter.  Instead we built an amazing hybrid solution of harware and software that filters and protects
        in real time.  Every request to the internet is analyzed for its content and then we put the power and control into your hands.
