      Kudos and Connected Partners

      Kudoso allows kids to earn Kudos, a virtual currency, by growing and learning through Kudoso Connected
      Partners like Kahn Acedemy and FitBit.  Kids can then use Kudos to unlock new content, "buy" additional
      screen time, or trade-in Kudos with their parents for allowance or other real goods.  Kudos are the
      positive rewards that help parents encourage their children to expand and learn beyond electronics.

        Kudos are the heart of Kudoso, after all, that is where our name comes from!  Kudos are a virtual currency
        that parents use to encourage and direct their children.  We built Kudoso to avoid the negative Draconian
        style that most partental control apps employ.
        %p
          Specifically, Kudos are earned by kids for not only doing what they have to do, but by doing what we as
          parents WANT them to do.  Parents can setup
          = link_to 'ToDos', '#todos'
          that connect to activities provided by Kudoso Connected Partners and kids can earn Kudos by completing these
          activities.
