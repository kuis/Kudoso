      Tasks and Connected Partners

      Kudoso helps teach kids about work ethic, responsibility and priorities through Tasks and Connected Partners.
      While it starts with "chores", Kudoso Tasks are so much more than chores we had to give it another name!  Tasks provide
      your child with a list of parent directed activities for the day.  The required Tasks restrict
      any screen time access until they are competed.  Parents can use optional Tasks to direct and
      encourage certain behaviors.  Best of all, kids are rewarded for a
      %span.bold
        Job Well Done
      by unlocking their screen time and earning Kudos which they can save up for a rainy day (literally, Kudos
      are great to have on a rainy day to unlock some extra screen time)!

        %h3 Kudos your kids will Love!
        Kudos are the heart of Kudoso, after all, that is where our name comes from!  Kudos are a virtual currency
        that parents use to encourage and direct their children.  We built Kudoso to avoid the negative Authoritarian
        style that most partental control apps employ.
        %p
          Specifically, Kudos are earned by kids for not only doing what they have to do, but by doing what we as
          parents WANT them to do.  Parents can setup Kudoso Tasks that connect to activities provided by Kudoso Connected
          Partners and kids can earn Kudos by completing these activities.
