        %h3 What makes Kudoso unique
        Kudoso is able to control more technology in your home than any other solution because we use a combination of
        hardware and software.  The solution begins with Kudoso software that gets installed on all computing devices like
        smart phones, tablets, desktop & laptop computers.  Then, we add the Kudoso Plug, a lockable smart-plug that
        brings software control to all the "dumb" electronics in the home like your television and game consoles.

        Just like we can use wirelessly connected outlets and switches to control the lights in our house, the
        %span.feature-title
          Kudoso Plug
        lets parents control when electronics can be turned on and used.  The Kudoso Plug features a clam-shell housing
        that creates a physical lock over the electrical cord of the device it is controlling, preventing kids from simply
        unplugging their device from the Kudoso Plug and utilizing a standard outlet.
