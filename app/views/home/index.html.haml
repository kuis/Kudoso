            Kudoso was developed to help parents manage the influence of technology
            on their children through the positive reinforcement of family values and
            life skills.

            Parents use a simple but powerful application from the web or the Kudoso
            Mobile App to create screen time restrictions, chore charts, content filters
            and approved activities for their children.

            %p
              Kudoso's proprietary Lockable SmartPlug allows parents to control devices
              that have never been controllable before.  Parents can now manage screen time
              on game consoles, bluray/dvd players, televisions and streaming media devices -
              anything that has a power plug!

              The Kudoso Gateway ensures that all devices in the home are accessing
              appropriate content, even those that friends bring over.  All devices
              accessing the internet are filtered through the gateway.  The gateway is also
              Kudoso's control center for the SmartPlugs.

            When kids do good things like finish their chores, learn something new,
            or even go play outside, they can earn Kudos - the Kudoso Virtual Currency.
            Just like money, kids can save and spend Kudos on rewards like more screen
            time, access to new games or apps, and just about anything you as a parent
            can dream up as you make your own rewards!

            Kudoso includes the ability to control Android and iOS devices in addition
            to household electronics.  When a child is out of screen time, they can
            still use the device to access the Kudodo app and view their chores and
            when they are allowed, the device is unlocked and they can use their approved apps.
            Mobile Device Management is only available in the Tamarack and Cedar plans.

            for iOS, Android, Mac and Windows PCs.  Filters are easy to setup and include four
            default levels: Strict, Moderate, Mature, and Monitor.  Content Filtering is only
            available in the Tamarack and Cedar plans.

      %p
        Thank you for your interest in Kudoso! Kudoso was founded a year ago to help parents manage the influence of technology on their children. The feedback has been very positive and we have recently revamped and expanded our scope to include ALL the technology our kids are influenced by. Kudoso is based in Montana and run by Michael and Charlene Kazmier. We are excited to present parents with a solution that reflects our family values and that can have a positive effect on all families!
      %p
        Being parents ourselves, we have seen how technology has become the main focus of our children. We knew we needed a solution to not only limit how much screen time our boys were getting, but also a way to control and guide the content they were viewing. We live in a world driven by technology which is rapidly growing and evolving, making it hard for parents to set boundaries. Most parents worry about the technology their kids are using, but aren’t sure how to regain control.  We can’t disconnect our children from our technology driven world, but we can set limits and guide them with Kudoso. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children limit screen time to no more than 2 hours per day and children under the age of 2 should have no exposure.
      %p
        Are your kids spending too much time in front of screens? Are they viewing content that is age appropriate? Are they learning life skills and responsibilities? Kudoso is the solution for you!
